        <ul>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <li>1 medium potato</li>
            <li>1/2 pound of ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound of ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/3 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of mustard powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of dried sage</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
            <li>15 ounces of refrigerated pie crust</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h4>Preparation Instructions</h4>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F</li>
            <li>Place the sliced potato in a saucepan with enough water to cover it. Bring it to a boil and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, mash, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Crumble ground beef and pork into a large saucepan. Add onion, garlic, mustard powder, thyme, sage, cloves, salt, and black pepper. Stir in water. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until meat is evenly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and mix in mashed potato.</li>
            <li>Ease one pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate. Fill with meat mixture, then top with the remaining pie crust. Trim any excess dough, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork to seal. Prick top crust a few times with a knife to vent steam. Cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve when ready!</li>
        </ul>
